## Coding time

The app took me about 5 hours to make

## Things I would continue to develop with more time:

- Make it scalable for different devices
- Style it further
- Add a theme switch function for users who prefer dark-mode
- Add an auto-complete function to the postcode input
- Expand upon error handling
- Implement further testing, specifically around the API fetching
- Split more of the code into separate components for better readability
